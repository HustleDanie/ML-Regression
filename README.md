<h1>Overview of Regression in Machine Learning</h1>
Regression in machine learning is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous target variable based on the input features. Unlike classification, which predicts categorical labels, regression predicts numerical values within a given range. It's commonly used for tasks such as predicting house prices, stock prices, temperature, sales forecasts, and many others.

Here's a breakdown of how regression works:

1. **Input Data**: Similar to classification, regression begins with a dataset consisting of labeled examples. Each example in the dataset contains a set of features (independent variables) and a corresponding target variable (dependent variable) that we want to predict. The features represent input factors that may influence the target variable.

2. **Training**: During the training phase, the regression algorithm learns from the labeled examples in the dataset to build a model that can predict the target variable based on the input features. The algorithm analyzes the relationship between the features and the target variable and learns the underlying patterns or trends in the data.

3. **Model Building**: Regression models come in various forms, each suited to different types of data and problem domains. Some common regression algorithms include linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression, random forest regression, and neural network regression.

4. **Evaluation**: After training the regression model, it's essential to evaluate its performance to assess how well it generalizes to new, unseen data. This is typically done using a separate portion of the dataset called the test set. Performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination) are commonly used to evaluate regression models.

5. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen instances. Given the features of an instance, the regression model predicts the numerical value of the target variable based on the learned patterns from the training data.

6. **Deployment**: Finally, the trained regression model can be deployed into production systems to automate prediction tasks. In real-world applications, regression models are used for various purposes, such as financial forecasting, demand prediction, risk assessment, and trend analysis.

<h2>Regression Types</h2>
Common regression types in machine learning:

1. **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used regression techniques. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable and fits a straight line to the data to make predictions.

2. **Polynomial Regression**: Polynomial regression extends linear regression by allowing for polynomial relationships between the input features and the target variable. It fits a curve to the data instead of a straight line, capturing more complex patterns in the data.

3. **Ridge Regression**: Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that incorporates L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which penalizes large coefficients, leading to a more robust model, especially when dealing with multicollinearity.

4. **Lasso Regression**: Lasso regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is another type of linear regression that incorporates L1 regularization. Like ridge regression, it adds a penalty term to the loss function, but in this case, it penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients. Lasso regression can perform feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively ignoring irrelevant features.

5. **ElasticNet Regression**: ElasticNet regression is a hybrid of ridge and lasso regression, combining both L1 and L2 regularization. It addresses the limitations of each method by introducing two penalty terms, allowing for more flexibility in controlling the balance between the two types of regularization.

6. **Decision Tree Regression**: Decision tree regression builds a tree structure to model the relationship between the input features and the target variable. It recursively splits the data into subsets based on feature thresholds and predicts the average target value within each subset.

7. **Random Forest Regression**: Random forest regression is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It builds a forest of trees using random subsets of the data and features and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and robustness.

8. **Gradient Boosting Regression**: Gradient boosting regression is another ensemble learning technique that builds a series of weak learners (typically decision trees) sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous ones. It is known for its high predictive accuracy and is widely used in competitions and real-world applications.

9. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Support vector regression extends support vector machines (SVM) to handle regression tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best fits the data while minimizing deviations from the target values within a specified margin.

10. **Neural Network Regression**: Neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures, can be used for regression tasks by training a network to map input features to continuous target values. Deep learning models such as feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly used for regression in various domains.

<h2>Regression Modelling Algorithms</h2>
Common regression modeling algorithms used in machine learning:

1. **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is a simple and widely used regression algorithm that models the relationship between the input features and the target variable using a linear equation. It seeks to minimize the difference between the observed and predicted values by adjusting the coefficients of the linear equation.

2. **Polynomial Regression**: Polynomial regression extends linear regression by introducing polynomial terms (e.g., quadratic, cubic) to capture nonlinear relationships between the input features and the target variable. It fits a curve to the data instead of a straight line, allowing for more flexibility in modeling complex patterns.

3. **Ridge Regression**: Ridge regression is a regularized version of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting. It includes a regularization parameter (lambda) that controls the strength of regularization, shrinking the coefficients towards zero and reducing their variance.

4. **Lasso Regression**: Lasso regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is another regularized linear regression technique that adds an L1 penalty term to the loss function. It encourages sparse solutions by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.

5. **ElasticNet Regression**: ElasticNet regression combines the penalties of ridge and lasso regression, incorporating both L1 and L2 regularization terms. It offers a balance between ridge and lasso regression, providing flexibility in handling multicollinearity and performing feature selection.

6. **Decision Tree Regression**: Decision tree regression builds a tree structure to model the relationship between the input features and the target variable. It recursively splits the data based on feature thresholds to minimize the variance of the target variable within each leaf node.

7. **Random Forest Regression**: Random forest regression is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It builds a forest of trees using random subsets of the data and features and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

8. **Gradient Boosting Regression**: Gradient boosting regression builds a series of weak learners (typically decision trees) sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous ones. It minimizes a loss function (e.g., mean squared error) by adding new trees that approximate the gradient of the loss function.

9. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Support vector regression extends support vector machines (SVM) to handle regression tasks. It seeks to find a hyperplane that best fits the data within a specified margin while minimizing deviations from the target values.

10. **Neural Network Regression**: Neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures, can be used for regression tasks by training a network to map input features to continuous target values. Deep learning models such as feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly used for regression in various domains.

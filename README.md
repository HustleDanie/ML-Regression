<h1>Regression Modelling Algorithms</h1>
1. Simple Linear Regression <br>
2. Multiple Linear Regression <br>
3. Polynomial Regression<br>
4. Support Vector Regression<br>
5. Decision Tree Regression<br>
6. Random Forest Regression<br>
7. XGBoost Regressor

<p>N.B: There are many more regression algorithm, just have to experiment as many as possible.</p>

<H1>Regression Model Selection.</H1>
<p>We make use of RSquared score to find the best algorithm among the 6 algorithms above for any given task.</p>

<p>Create a template using all the different algorithms and then use the Rsquared Score to check the performance of all everything.</p>
